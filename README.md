# Crappy_encryptor

Really simple encryptor made with python. All this program does is switch every vowel for the next one and the same with consonants, so a 
becomes e and b becomes c. I really don't recommend you use this for anything serious but feel free to do so if you wish, just know that  it's 
really easy to decipher. It was more of a learning project than anything else.
